B1.c

1.It exist because it may be called from another file.compiler cannot know it before link time.

2.If the function was declared with the "static" keyword  then  the function body will disappear if there is no caller within the file.

B3.c

1.a take the value from 0-99.
As a is never less than 4 if condition is not processed and therefore it get eliminated by compiler.

B4.c

1.The original code has 2 computation but in fre pass it uses the temporary variable which stores result of initial computation.(i.e. a+c). Therefore one line execution.

2.Check  the   file  B-4.c.*.optimized.   This  is  the   last  GIMPLE  intra-procedural pass. If  it is same as the output  of FRE, then no more optimizations have occured.

3   "return  b" was  required to  make the  computation of  variable `b' meaningful. If function  `main' is going to "return 0"  and there is  no other  output, GCC  will realise that  the entire  computation of variable `b' was  dead code and will eliminate  its dependencies one by one until the resulting program reduces to:
